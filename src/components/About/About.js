                    ddemonstrate provides a platform for anyone to freely create and co-ordinate activist campaigns and to make anonymous financial contributions via cryptocurrency. By using cryptocurrencies and the Ethereum blockchain, it allows safe and secure socialisation of demonstrations. 
                <br />
                <br />
                    The platform enables supporters and contributors of the cause who could not otherwise participate, to donate funds securely and anonymously without requiring third party banks or payment gateways who can reverse transactions or close accounts.
